## From a Veteran User’s Perspective

*"I’ve been around a while, testing darknet sites — many come and go. What sets http://hh2paw7ouhfjozylujs3qp4rql7xc76ce63ffzvtlpicjqgeiqxp4oad.onion apart is their clear focus on safety, especially for Canadian users. They strictly regulate what’s sold, banning weapons and terrorism-related goods, which gives me peace of mind that I’m not getting entangled in dangerous scams or worse. Their marketplace is straightforward and clean, designed to foster trust among buyers and sellers."*

We the North launched in 2021 as a successor to the Canadian Headquarters market shutdown. It’s a Canadian-centered marketplace that purposely creates a "safe environment" for its community.
